# CS-300

**1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problem was how to design algorithms for data structure as well as understanding their run-time complexities and practical advantages and disadvantages.

**2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by reading the textbook and participating in the course activities until I understood the code I was writing. Data structures are important to understand because they often serve as fundamental parts of good working coode.

**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

If I encountered any roadbloacks I would usually take a short break in order to clear my mind or let any ideas sink in. I would also seek extra resources such as online searches for solutions to the problems I was having.

**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project served as good practice for the C++ language itself. On top of that, it was good practice to plan for projects since we designed the program through pseudocode beforehand.

**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

For this project I started using more comments then I usually do which is necessary for any large coding projects. I also have a better understanding of working with classes on a higher level since we designed the actual data structures as classes and then worked with the classes themselves. Writing code like that makes it very easy to re-use which is important for such fundamental algorithms.
